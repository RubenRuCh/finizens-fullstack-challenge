<h1>Finizens Full Stack Challenge</h1>
<p>This is a mocked server using json-server set up for this challenge</p>
<p>You can make all the needed requests at the following endpoints, notice you can still use REST methods like POST, GET, PUT, PATCH and DELETE. We suggest checking the .feature files to get an idea.</p>
<p>Notice this is a mocked server so there are some lacking features, for instance, when completing any buy/sell order it wont modify its related portfolio allocation shares although we hope it should be enough for a frontend showcase.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://localhost:3000/api/orders">orders</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://localhost:3000/api/portfolios">portfolios</a></li>
</ul>
